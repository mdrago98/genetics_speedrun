# Introduction to Molecular Genetics
Genetics is the study of genes, genetic variation and heredity in biology.
It is an important branch as  heredity is vital to organisms' evolution. 

## DNA

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries genetic information for the functioning of the organism.
It is made from two linked strands winding around each other to form a double helix. Each strand has a backbone made
from alternative sugar (_deoxyribose_) and phosphates. 

Attached to each deoxyribose molecule is one of 4 bases:

1) adenine (A),
2) cytosine (C), 
3) guanine (G)
4) thymine (T)

The strand are connected by chemical bonds in the following order:

1) adenine (A) -> thymine (T)
2) cytosine (C) -> thymine (T)

Side note on the helix structure. The major groove is 12 Angstroms wide and the minor is 8 angstroms wide 


## Genes
A gene is the basic unit of inheritance where these are passed from the parents to the offspring.
These contain all the genetic information needed to define physical traits and characteristics. 
Most genes code for specific proteins or protein segments. We have around 20K protein coding genes. 

A gene can be made up of coding exons and non coding introns from the DNA as shown:

## Gene expression

Genes express their functional effect through the production of _proteins_
(molecules responsible for most cell function). Proteins are made of 1 or more strands of polypeptide chains
each composed of _amino acids_.


### Transcription

The process of making RNA copies of a gene's DNA. The DNA sequence of a gene produces an RNA molecule (_messenger_rna_)
with a similar sequence matching the DNA sequence called _transcription_. mRNA contains the gene's protein information encoded in the DNA.
mRNA moves from the cell nucleus to the cell cytoplasm through the membrane.

### Central dogma

The central dogma of molecular biology implies that the flow of information
is unidirectional in such a way: DNA <-> RNA -> Protein

### Translation

The process by which an mRNA molecule directs the addition of amino acids in the cell during protein synthesis.
This process takes place in the cell cytoplasm where the resulting chain is read and the protein is synthesised.

The messenger rna molecule produces a subsequent amino acid chain in a process called translation.

Each group of 3 nucleotides (_codon_) corresponds to a list of 20 potential amino acids or stop instruction in the genetic sequence.

### Proteins
Proteins are large molecules playing several important roles in the body. They are required for structure function and regulation of tissues and organs.
A protein is made up of one or more chains of amino acids whose sequence is determined by the DNA of a protein encoding gene.
A specific sequence of amino acids have a specific unique 3d shape that they form which corresponds with their function.

#### Organisation

The protein can have multiple levels of organisation namely:

1) the first level which is the primary protein structure
2) the second level where the chain folds into a 3d structure
3) the third level where a mature protein fold upon itself
4) the fourth is when the protein matures and contains more than one polypeptide chain.


## Chromosomes
These are thread structures made up of proteins and a singular DNA molecule which serve to carry genetic 
information from cell to cell. Humans have a total of 23 pairs 22 pairs of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY).
Each pair contains one pair coming from each of the parents respectively.

The DNA wraps around the chromosome around a nucleosomes chromatin which is made up of 8 histone proteins.
A nucleosome wraps around 150 base pairs of dna. When the chromatin is open transcription can occur and when closed transcription cannot occur.
This process of opening up/closing the protein is regulated through _methylation_  where the histone is marked with an epigenetic mark.
